While taking input from user (a 1 b 2...etc) 
If user enter QUIT GAME game is closing. // I couldn't manage to implement this feature in this homework
If user enter LOAD FILENAME.TXT load the file
If user enter SAVE FILENAME.TXT save the file

I couldn't find enough time to complete as expected. I couldn't make the main menu but functions are work as expected.

for default game I sent 2 files, You can use one of tham after entering size and opponent (LOAD FILE1.TXT etc..)
I implement both pre and postfix overload (to use that feature you should type 'undo move')
I did == overload.

While taking input from user (a 1 b 2...etc) 
If user enter QUIT GAME game is closing.
If user enter LOAD FILENAME.TXT load the file
If user enter SAVE FILENAME.TXT save the file


for default game I sent 2 files, You can use one of tham after entering size and opponent (LOAD FILE1.TXT etc..)
In this homework for some functiouns I am confused so maybe 1 or 2 of them does not exist in my code.
It is not completely true regardless to what you are expecting
